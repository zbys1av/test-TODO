HOW TO USE: 
There are 2 parts of the app.

Upper  (first) part is used to add your own tasks.
Just type anything into input field and press "ADD" to add a task to a list which will be displayed bellow.
Right under "ADD" button you can find the filter button , which can be used to filter our list of tasks. There are 3 options "all", "completed", "uncompleted"

Lower (second) part is used for our API tasks. 
Functionality of that part is simple - you can only see a whole list of tasks or click "check" button to open a specific task.
